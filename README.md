# Catalog-Demand

## Business Problem

You recently started working for a company that manufactures and sells high-end home goods. Last year the company sent out its first print catalog, and is preparing to send out this year's catalog in the coming months. The company has 250 new customers from their mailing list that they want to send the catalog to.

Your manager has been asked to determine how much profit the company can expect from sending a catalog to these customers. You, the business analyst, are assigned to help your manager run the numbers. While fairly knowledgeable about data analysis, your manager is not very familiar with predictive models.

Youâ€™ve been asked to predict the expected profit from these 250 new customers. Management does not want to send the catalog out to these new customers unless the expected profit contribution exceeds `$10,000`.

## Details

The costs of printing and distributing is `$6.50` per catalog.

The average gross margin (price - cost) on all products sold through the catalog is `50%`.

Make sure to multiply your revenue by the gross margin first before you subtract out the `$6.50` cost when calculating your profit.

We want to calculate the expected revenue from these 250 people in order to get expected profit. This means we need to multiply the probability that a person will buy our catalog as well. For example, if a customer were to buy from us, we predict this customer will buy `$450` worth of products. At a 30% chance that this person will actually buy from us, we can expect revenue to be `$450 x 30% = $135`
